# Evolving Ms. PacMan #

In order to curb the reign of terror that ghosts have in the PacMan world, this project aims to evolve an automated controller for Ms. PacMan (represented as a function tree) using the core concepts of evolution, including mating, mutation, selective pressure, and fitness evaluation. Developed for the Fall 2018 session of CS 5401 - Introduction to Evolutionary Computing at Missouri University of Science and Technology.
